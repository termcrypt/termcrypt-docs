## Commands

You can view all available commands inside termcrypt with `help` or `h`. Most commands have a long name and a short name for higher efficiency. There are two types of commands: ones where you just input the command name, and ones with parameters such as command [parameter]. Commands with parameters are documented here and inside termcrypt.
